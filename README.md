# Grocery List

This project was the first project I completed for my Advanced Web Development class. This project makes use of ASP.NET Core as well as the MVC architecture. This project was created in Visual Studio with version 1.1.* of ASP.NET Core.

This project allows users to create profiles and keep track of grocery lists. The user can create grocery lists, add items to the lists, remove items from the list, grant and revoke access to specific lists, and check items off of the list. AJAX is used to update the information in the databaase, but the page must be refreshed for the updated information to be displayed. 

This project taught me how to use AJAX and Javascript to update a page without having to refresh. It also taught me how to work with authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core.
